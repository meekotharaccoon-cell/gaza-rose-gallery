## \ud83c\udf44 Gaza Rose Mycelium \u2014 A Living Digital Humanitarian System

**Built by Meeko. Runs itself. Funds Gaza aid.**

---

### What This Is

Gaza Rose Gallery is 56 original 300 DPI digital flowers, \$1 each, 70% straight to the Palestine Children Relief Fund.

But the gallery is just the visible part.

Underneath it is a **living digital organism** \u2014 the Meeko Mycelium \u2014 with real anatomy:

| Part | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| \ud83e\udde0 Brain | Private GitHub repo. Remembers everything. |
| \u2764\ufe0f Heart | GitHub Actions. Beats twice a day. Never stops. |
| \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Eyes | Health checks + SerpAPI. Sees the web. |
| \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Voice | Discord + Mastodon + Dev.to. Speaks to the world. |
| \ud83e\udd32 Hands | PayPal + Stripe + Gumroad + Coinbase. Moves money. |
| \ud83e\ude78 Blood | Bitcoin + PayPal. Value flows. |
| \ud83d\udca1 Mind | OpenRouter AI. Generates content. Makes decisions. |

### How It Works

Every morning at 9AM EST and every evening at 9PM EST, without any human touching anything:

1. GitHub Actions wakes the system
2. It checks the gallery is alive
3. It posts to all connected platforms
4. It updates its brain repo with the current state
5. It goes back to sleep

**Cost: \$0/month.** Built entirely on free tiers.

### The Principles (SolarPunk)

- Open source \u2014 everything on GitHub, readable and forkable
- No ads, no tracking, no surveillance capitalism
- Mission-first \u2014 70% to PCRF, always, automatically
- Self-sustaining \u2014 no dependency on any single platform
- Transparent \u2014 every workflow readable at github.com/meekotharaccoon-cell/meeko-nerve-center

### One Human. A Keyboard. Weeks of Typing.

Meeko didn't raise capital. Didn't wait for permission. Just started typing at AI until a working system existed.

**This is the proof that one person with internet access can build something that actually helps.**

### Fork It

The entire system is open source. Take it. Build your own. Change the cause. Change the art. Keep the ethics.

\$1. 70% to children in Gaza. The rest keeps the system growing.
